#Solution Design

##UI-Design
UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app, or electronic device. UX refers to the entire interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction.
User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience.

##Workflow-Design
Workflow design is the process of outlining all the tasks and processes in a visual format like flow diagrams or flowcharts. All the team members and stakeholders get a high-level overview of each task in the process with the help of an accurate workflow design.
Start by identifying the different tasks and activities in your process using a basic flowchart. Create clear start and end points so that you know how the process should begin and what needs to be completed in order to finalize it. Then document every task between the start and end points, and ensure that each step is properly integrated into the workflow design process. Remember to indicate the relationship between the steps (i.e., whether steps are contingent on one another or can be completed concurrently).
